# Contributing guide

Read our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you find a problem or want to develop a new feature and an issue doesn't already exist on this, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

If you find an issue to work on, create a branch named [fix/...] or [feature/...] as required.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request. Base your changes on develop branch.

### Your PR is merged

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en).
